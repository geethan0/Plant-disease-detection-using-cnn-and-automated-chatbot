Plant Disease Detection Using CNN and Automated Chatbot
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect plant leaf diseases from images and suggests the top 3 possible results with confidence levels. An automated chatbot powered by the Google Gemini API provides information and treatment guidance based on the detected disease. Users can also generate a PDF report summarizing the diagnosis and suggestions.
